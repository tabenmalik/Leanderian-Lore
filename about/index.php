		Kameron is what you might consider average, 
		but that's only skin deep. A unique personality with a talent 
		for mastering accents quickly, comical timing, frustrating 
		his parents, and arguably, writing decent books. His hit and 
		miss strategy, well, hits and misses, though he proudly boasts a 
		success rate of 70% in his jokes, up by 70% from three years ago. 
		When told "Dude, we should totally write a book about all this 
		crap." he responded, "Challenge accepted."

		"Let there be light!"<br/>
		"No." Taben responded.<br>
		"Who dares to defy- oh. Hey man."<br>
		"Wassup G."<br>
		And so there was compromise, and that's why there is night, 
		not just day. Taben's career is not one of the spotlight and 
		the stage, of lines and thunderous applause. It is one of 
		hard work, toil, frustration, and in the end, some of the 
		most majestic technical work ever to grace the PAC stage. He 
		has made significant strides in lighting during his high school 
		career. Comfortable and skilled with moving about in darkness, 
		his silent steps and dark garb earned him the title of the Ninja. 
		His persistence to web design, computers, and code writing have given 
		him a well-balanced skill set that serves him every day. A devoted 
		student of his craft, a fast learner, and humorous, trustworthy, 
		honorable friend, Taben is a man I would be proud any day to call Brother.
		-Kameron

	<h2>The Website</h2>

		Though in the book, it is different (see the Author's Note), 
		the Website actually came about as an offer. With the seniors leaving, 
		the book incomplete, and no method of publication for those seniors to 
		see the end to their stories in my book, Taben came to me with a 
		question. "Can I make a website for this?" I of course, said "Sure." 
		And so it was. While I was out smelling the roses, moving pylons and step 
		units, and listening to the theater students talk (the inspiration for 
		most of my work), Taben was experimenting, collaborating and through much 
		trial and error, created a website. This website is not just some internet 
		address that one can read a book on, this is to be the Bastion of the 
		fiction, the Sanctuary of the lore, and the Retreat for the seniors of 2013 
		and beyond to come back, read, and remember their high school days. Though 
		it may seem somewhat bare-bones now, Taben and I have big plans. Big. One day, 
		there will be a page for people to submit there artwork of the book, to do 
		hilarious Audio-Book re-reads of chapters, discuss chapters, to converse about 
		their lives after high school, to reconnect, and most importantly, to talk 
		about what a great web-designer Taben is.

	So you're looking at the source code eh? You think you're so cool
	looking at something that possibly doesn't make sense to you? Yeah
	well just a heads up Chachi, I, Taben Malik, wrote every single
	line of code that runs this website excluding the lines of code
	that make up html, php5, css, apache2, proftpd.
	The organization is kinda of whack as of right now.
	It's like my bedroom, I sacrifice organization for efficiency.
	So since you're so cool to look at my source code, how 'bout
	you get on my level and design one for yourself.
